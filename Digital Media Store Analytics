--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about a digital media store 'chinook' data. 

/* Analysis */

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT Customerid, Firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country NOT IN('USA');


#2.What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


#3.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;


#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";


#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices;
